          Silk Travels is a comprehensive travel booking platform developed at Xecutors 
          using Gogency's template system. The website serves as the front-end interface 
          for Gogency's travel management system, generated with a single click from their portal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform integrates multiple APIs including Amadeus API for 
          flight data, Google Gmail API for communication, 
          Stripe API for payments, and WhatsApp API 
          for customer interactions. Consultants can perform CRUD operations, generate invoices, 
          and manage all travel bookings through the portal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, 
          the website displays available flights and allows users to submit inquiries. These 
          inquiries are sent to the backend where consultants can interact with potential 
          customers, provide ticket options, and complete bookings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project demonstrates the power of Gogency's template system while showcasing 
          complex API integrations and a seamless user experience for both travelers and 
          travel consultants.
